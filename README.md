Customer attrition (a.k.a customer churn) is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.

This project is about predicting the customer churn in a organisation based on 10years of data. Major stages to successfully predict customer churn include;

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Evaluation
3. Model Selection
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Improvement
6. Future Predictions
7. Model Deployment

we have data on current and prior customer transactions in the power and energy company dataset, I am doing a standardized supervised classification problem that tries to predict a binary outcome Yes or No(Y/N).
